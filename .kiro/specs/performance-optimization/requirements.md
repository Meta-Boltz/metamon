# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance bottlenecks in the Metamon framework by implementing service worker-based lazy loading for framework cores and execution logic. Currently, supporting multiple frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid) requires loading all framework cores upfront, creating significant bundle size and initial load time issues. This solution will implement on-demand loading through service workers, SSR optimization, and layout shift prevention to dramatically improve performance metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the initial page load to be fast regardless of how many frameworks are used in the application, so that I don't experience long loading times or poor Core Web Vitals scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN only the minimal runtime core SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN a framework component is needed THEN its framework core SHALL be loaded on-demand within 100ms
3. WHEN multiple framework components are on the same page THEN framework cores SHALL be loaded in parallel
4. WHEN a framework core is loaded THEN it SHALL be cached for subsequent use
5. WHEN the initial bundle is analyzed THEN it SHALL contain less than 50KB of framework code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want framework cores to be delivered through service workers, so that they don't block the main thread and can be cached efficiently across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a framework core is requested THEN it SHALL be served from the service worker cache if available
2. WHEN a framework core is not cached THEN the service worker SHALL fetch and cache it transparently
3. WHEN framework cores are updated THEN the service worker SHALL invalidate old caches automatically
4. WHEN the service worker is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to direct loading gracefully
5. WHEN framework execution occurs THEN heavy computations SHALL be offloaded to service worker when possible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want server-side rendering to work seamlessly with lazy-loaded frameworks, so that I get fast initial paint and good SEO while maintaining performance benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is server-rendered THEN all visible components SHALL render without requiring client-side framework loading
2. WHEN SSR content is hydrated THEN framework cores SHALL be loaded only for interactive components
3. WHEN non-visible components exist THEN their framework cores SHALL remain unloaded until needed
4. WHEN SSR fails THEN the client SHALL gracefully fallback to client-side rendering with lazy loading
5. WHEN critical rendering path is analyzed THEN SSR SHALL not depend on client-side framework bundles

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to experience minimal layout shift during framework loading, so that the page remains stable and usable throughout the loading process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework components are loading THEN placeholder elements SHALL maintain exact dimensions
2. WHEN framework cores are being fetched THEN loading indicators SHALL appear without shifting existing content
3. WHEN components are hydrated THEN the transition SHALL be visually seamless
4. WHEN measuring Cumulative Layout Shift THEN the score SHALL remain below 0.1
5. WHEN components fail to load THEN error states SHALL not cause layout shifts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent preloading strategies, so that likely-needed framework cores are loaded proactively without impacting initial performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user interaction patterns are detected THEN relevant framework cores SHALL be preloaded
2. WHEN components are in the viewport THEN their framework cores SHALL be preloaded with low priority
3. WHEN navigation is likely THEN framework cores for the target page SHALL be prefetched
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN preloading SHALL be throttled or disabled
5. WHEN preloading occurs THEN it SHALL not interfere with critical resource loading

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want execution logic to be offloaded from the main thread, so that the UI remains responsive during complex operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN heavy computations are needed THEN they SHALL be executed in service worker threads
2. WHEN component state updates occur THEN they SHALL be batched and processed efficiently
3. WHEN multiple frameworks are active THEN their execution SHALL not block each other
4. WHEN service worker execution fails THEN operations SHALL fallback to main thread gracefully
5. WHEN measuring main thread blocking time THEN it SHALL remain below 50ms for 95% of operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want progressive enhancement that works without service workers, so that the application functions on all browsers and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service workers are not supported THEN the application SHALL function with direct loading
2. WHEN service worker registration fails THEN the system SHALL fallback transparently
3. WHEN network is offline THEN cached framework cores SHALL still be available
4. WHEN service worker updates fail THEN the application SHALL continue with existing cached versions
5. WHEN progressive enhancement is tested THEN all core functionality SHALL work without service workers

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent bundling and code splitting, so that framework cores are optimized for lazy loading and caching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework cores are bundled THEN they SHALL be split into logical chunks for optimal caching
2. WHEN shared dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be extracted into separate cacheable chunks
3. WHEN framework versions are updated THEN only changed chunks SHALL require re-downloading
4. WHEN bundle analysis is performed THEN chunk sizes SHALL be optimized for HTTP/2 multiplexing
5. WHEN caching strategies are applied THEN they SHALL maximize cache hit rates across different page loads

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools, so that I can optimize performance and troubleshoot loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance monitoring is enabled THEN loading times for each framework core SHALL be tracked
2. WHEN cache performance is analyzed THEN hit/miss rates SHALL be reported
3. WHEN loading failures occur THEN detailed error information SHALL be logged
4. WHEN service worker operations happen THEN they SHALL be visible in debugging tools
5. WHEN performance budgets are exceeded THEN warnings SHALL be displayed to developers

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably across different network conditions, so that performance remains acceptable on slow or unreliable connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network is slow THEN framework loading SHALL be prioritized by importance
2. WHEN connection is intermittent THEN cached framework cores SHALL be used when available
3. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN loading strategies SHALL adapt to reduce data usage
4. WHEN network fails during loading THEN graceful degradation SHALL maintain basic functionality
5. WHEN connection quality changes THEN loading strategies SHALL adjust dynamically
