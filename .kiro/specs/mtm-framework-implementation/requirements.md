# MTM Framework Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete MTM (Meta-Template-Metamon) framework that allows developers to write components once using a unified syntax and compile them to multiple target frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Pure JavaScript). The framework includes a modern syntax with reactive variables, template blocks, and cross-framework signal system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MTM Syntax Parser and Compiler

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to write components using MTM syntax so that I can target multiple frameworks with a single codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes an MTM file with `.mtm` extension THEN the system SHALL parse the modern MTM syntax including `$variable!` reactive declarations
2. WHEN an MTM file uses filename-based framework detection (e.g., `counter.react.mtm`) THEN the system SHALL compile to the appropriate target framework
3. WHEN an MTM file has no framework extension (e.g., `counter.mtm`) THEN the system SHALL compile to pure JavaScript
4. WHEN MTM syntax includes `<template>` blocks THEN the system SHALL transform them to framework-specific template syntax
5. WHEN MTM syntax includes reactive variables with `$` prefix THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate reactive state management code

### Requirement 2: Multi-Framework Code Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my MTM components to compile to React, Vue, Svelte, SolidJS, and Pure HTML/JavaScript so that I can use them in any project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling to React THEN the system SHALL generate JSX with hooks (useState, useCallback) and proper event handlers
2. WHEN compiling to Vue THEN the system SHALL generate Vue 3 composition API with reactive refs and template syntax
3. WHEN compiling to Svelte THEN the system SHALL generate Svelte syntax with reactive statements and event handlers
4. WHEN compiling to SolidJS THEN the system SHALL generate SolidJS components with createSignal and JSX
5. WHEN compiling to Pure HTML/JS THEN the system SHALL generate complete HTML files with embedded JavaScript (PHP/Next.js style)
6. WHEN using signal system THEN the system SHALL maintain cross-framework state synchronization

### Requirement 3: Signal System Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified signal system so that components can share state across different frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `signal('key', initialValue)` THEN the system SHALL create a global reactive signal
2. WHEN emitting events with `emit('event', data)` THEN the system SHALL broadcast to all listening components
3. WHEN components subscribe to signals THEN the system SHALL update all subscribers when signal values change
4. WHEN signals are used across different frameworks THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state
5. WHEN components are destroyed THEN the system SHALL clean up signal subscriptions

### Requirement 4: Template System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a clean template syntax so that I can write readable UI code that compiles to any framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `{$variable}` interpolation THEN the system SHALL bind reactive data to the template
2. WHEN using `click={$handler}` event binding THEN the system SHALL generate framework-specific event handlers
3. WHEN using `{#if condition}` conditionals THEN the system SHALL generate conditional rendering code
4. WHEN using `{#each items as item}` loops THEN the system SHALL generate list rendering code
5. WHEN using `{#for i=0 to 9}` range loops THEN the system SHALL generate numeric iteration code
6. WHEN compiling to Pure HTML THEN the system SHALL generate server-side rendering compatible templates with embedded JavaScript

### Requirement 5: Development Tools and CLI

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CLI tools and development utilities so that I can efficiently work with MTM components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `mtm compile <file>` THEN the system SHALL compile MTM files to target frameworks
2. WHEN running `mtm watch <directory>` THEN the system SHALL automatically recompile on file changes
3. WHEN running `mtm migrate <file>` THEN the system SHALL convert legacy syntax to modern MTM syntax
4. WHEN using development mode THEN the system SHALL provide source maps and error reporting
5. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with line numbers

### Requirement 6: Example Components and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive examples and documentation so that I can learn and use the MTM framework effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing examples THEN the system SHALL provide counter, form, and list components in MTM format for all supported frameworks
2. WHEN viewing compiled output THEN the system SHALL show side-by-side comparison of MTM and target framework code including SolidJS and Pure HTML
3. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL include syntax reference, API documentation, and migration guides
4. WHEN running examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate cross-framework state sharing including SolidJS integration
5. WHEN testing examples THEN the system SHALL include working HTML pages that load compiled components and pure HTML/JS versions
