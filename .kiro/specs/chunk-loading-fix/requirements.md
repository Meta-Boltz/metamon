# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Metamon framework is experiencing a critical issue with chunk loading in the browser. When attempting to load dynamic chunks from .mtm files, users encounter the error: "Failed to load chunk \_src_pages_index_mtm_import_mtm_transformed: TypeError: Cannot set property data of #<Object> which has only a getter at index.mtm:1:1". This error prevents the application from functioning correctly and needs to be addressed to ensure proper dynamic loading of components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Metamon framework user, I want the dynamic chunk loading mechanism to work correctly so that my application can load components without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dynamic chunk is requested THEN the system SHALL load it without throwing TypeError related to setting properties on objects with only getters
2. WHEN a .mtm file is transformed THEN the system SHALL ensure the generated code is compatible with the chunk loading mechanism
3. WHEN chunks are loaded dynamically THEN the system SHALL properly handle the data property assignment
4. IF a chunk fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful error message that helps diagnose the issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Metamon framework developer, I want to understand and fix the root cause of the chunk loading issue so that I can prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the code THEN the system SHALL identify where the TypeError is occurring in the chunk loading process
2. WHEN examining the transformed .mtm files THEN the system SHALL identify any patterns that lead to the error
3. WHEN fixing the issue THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility with existing .mtm files
4. WHEN implementing the fix THEN the system SHALL include appropriate error handling for edge cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Metamon framework user, I want comprehensive testing of the chunk loading mechanism so that I can be confident it works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the framework THEN the system SHALL include specific tests for the chunk loading mechanism
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify that chunks with various component types load correctly
3. WHEN chunks are loaded in different environments THEN the system SHALL work consistently across supported browsers
4. WHEN chunks are loaded in production builds THEN the system SHALL work as expected with minification and code splitting
