# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive multi-framework chunk loading example system that demonstrates successful, error-free chunk loading across all major JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Vanilla JS) plus our custom MTM (Metamon) framework. Each framework will have its own dedicated example page showcasing clean chunk loading without any errors, providing developers with working reference implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see working chunk loading examples for each major JavaScript framework, so that I can understand how to implement error-free chunk loading in my preferred framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the multi-framework examples THEN the system SHALL display a main navigation page with links to each framework
2. WHEN I click on a framework link THEN the system SHALL navigate to a dedicated page for that framework
3. WHEN I view any framework page THEN the system SHALL show only successful chunk loading examples without any errors
4. WHEN I interact with chunk loading examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate smooth loading without TypeError exceptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using React, I want to see React-specific chunk loading examples, so that I can implement safe chunk loading with React.lazy() and Suspense.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the React examples page THEN the system SHALL display React components using React.lazy()
2. WHEN React components load THEN the system SHALL show proper Suspense fallback UI
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL display the loaded component without errors
4. WHEN I navigate between React examples THEN the system SHALL maintain state and show smooth transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using Vue, I want to see Vue-specific chunk loading examples, so that I can implement safe chunk loading with defineAsyncComponent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Vue examples page THEN the system SHALL display Vue components using defineAsyncComponent
2. WHEN Vue components load THEN the system SHALL show proper loading states
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL render the component using Vue 3 Composition API
4. WHEN I interact with Vue examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate reactive data binding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using Svelte, I want to see Svelte-specific chunk loading examples, so that I can implement safe chunk loading with Svelte's component system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Svelte examples page THEN the system SHALL display dynamically loaded Svelte components
2. WHEN Svelte components load THEN the system SHALL show proper lifecycle management
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL mount components with proper cleanup
4. WHEN I navigate between Svelte examples THEN the system SHALL handle component destruction properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using Angular, I want to see Angular-specific chunk loading examples, so that I can implement safe chunk loading with Angular's lazy loading system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Angular examples page THEN the system SHALL display Angular components with lazy loading
2. WHEN Angular components load THEN the system SHALL use Angular's dependency injection
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL render components with proper change detection
4. WHEN I interact with Angular examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate Angular services and routing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using Vanilla JavaScript, I want to see pure JavaScript chunk loading examples, so that I can implement safe chunk loading without any framework dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the Vanilla JS examples page THEN the system SHALL display pure JavaScript implementations
2. WHEN JavaScript modules load THEN the system SHALL use native ES6 dynamic imports
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL manipulate DOM directly without framework overhead
4. WHEN I interact with Vanilla examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate manual state management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer interested in the MTM framework, I want to see MTM-specific chunk loading examples, so that I can understand how our custom framework handles chunk loading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the MTM examples page THEN the system SHALL display MTM framework components
2. WHEN MTM components load THEN the system SHALL use our safe property assignment utility
3. WHEN chunk loading completes THEN the system SHALL demonstrate MTM's unique features
4. WHEN I interact with MTM examples THEN the system SHALL show framework-specific optimizations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified navigation system across all framework examples, so that I can easily switch between different implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am on any framework page THEN the system SHALL display a consistent navigation header
2. WHEN I click navigation links THEN the system SHALL switch between frameworks smoothly
3. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and layout
4. WHEN I use browser back/forward THEN the system SHALL handle routing correctly

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see performance metrics for each framework's chunk loading, so that I can compare implementation efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any framework example THEN the system SHALL display loading time metrics
2. WHEN chunk loading occurs THEN the system SHALL measure and report performance data
3. WHEN I compare frameworks THEN the system SHALL show relative performance indicators
4. WHEN I view metrics THEN the system SHALL display memory usage and bundle size information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the source code for each framework example, so that I can understand the implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any framework example THEN the system SHALL provide a "View Source" option
2. WHEN I click "View Source" THEN the system SHALL display the relevant code with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN I view source code THEN the system SHALL show both the framework-specific code and the safe assignment utility
4. WHEN I copy code examples THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted, runnable code snippets
