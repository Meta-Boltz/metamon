# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Ultra-Modern MTM Routing and Build System needs to provide seamless navigation between pages, proper 404 handling, and a robust build-time transformation pipeline that works with Vite. The current implementation faces critical issues where Vite's import analysis runs before MTM plugin transformation, preventing .mtm files from being processed correctly. This feature focuses on creating a build-time route generation system, proper Vite plugin integration, and working client-side navigation with SSR support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want .mtm files to be properly transformed by the build system before any import analysis, so that I can use ultra-modern MTM syntax without Vite parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a .mtm file with frontmatter THEN the build system SHALL parse it correctly without JavaScript syntax errors
2. WHEN Vite processes .mtm files THEN the MTM plugin SHALL transform them before import analysis runs
3. WHEN I use ultra-modern MTM syntax THEN the build system SHALL convert it to valid JavaScript
4. IF there are syntax errors in .mtm files THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages with line numbers
5. WHEN I save a .mtm file THEN hot module replacement SHALL work correctly with the transformed code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build-time route generation from .mtm page files, so that I can have working navigation without runtime import issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create pages in the pages/ directory THEN the build system SHALL automatically generate a route manifest
2. WHEN I define routes in frontmatter THEN the system SHALL register them in the route table
3. WHEN the application builds THEN all .mtm pages SHALL be pre-transformed and ready for import
4. WHEN I add or remove page files THEN the route manifest SHALL update automatically
5. IF there are duplicate routes THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want client-side navigation between pages to work seamlessly, so that I can browse the application without full page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on internal links THEN the router SHALL navigate without full page reload
2. WHEN I navigate to a new page THEN the content SHALL update smoothly with loading states
3. WHEN I use browser back/forward buttons THEN the navigation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN I bookmark or refresh a page THEN the correct page SHALL load
5. IF navigation fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper 404 error handling when I visit non-existent pages, so that I get helpful feedback and navigation options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit a non-existent URL THEN the system SHALL show the 404 page
2. WHEN I'm on the 404 page THEN I SHALL see search functionality and suggested pages
3. WHEN I search from the 404 page THEN the system SHALL provide relevant results
4. WHEN I click suggested links THEN navigation SHALL work correctly
5. IF the 404 page itself fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a fallback error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want server-side rendering support for all pages, so that I can have optimal SEO and initial page load performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are requested THEN they SHALL render on the server with full HTML content
2. WHEN the client loads THEN hydration SHALL happen progressively without layout shifts
3. WHEN search engines crawl pages THEN they SHALL receive fully rendered HTML
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN basic page content SHALL still be accessible
5. IF SSR fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to client-side rendering gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper integration with Vite's development server, so that I can have fast development with hot reload and proper error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the dev server THEN all .mtm files SHALL be processed correctly
2. WHEN I make changes to .mtm files THEN hot reload SHALL update the page instantly
3. WHEN there are compilation errors THEN they SHALL be displayed in the browser overlay
4. WHEN I add new pages THEN they SHALL be available immediately without restart
5. IF the MTM plugin fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear debugging information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want support for dynamic routes and route parameters, so that I can create flexible page structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create files like [id].mtm THEN they SHALL handle dynamic route parameters
2. WHEN I access route parameters THEN they SHALL be available in the page context
3. WHEN I create catch-all routes like [...slug].mtm THEN they SHALL handle multiple path segments
4. WHEN I navigate to dynamic routes THEN the correct page SHALL render with proper parameters
5. IF route parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want internationalization support in routing, so that I can create multi-language applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define multiple routes in frontmatter THEN the system SHALL support i18n routing
2. WHEN I access different language routes THEN the correct locale SHALL be detected
3. WHEN I switch languages THEN the navigation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN search engines crawl THEN each language version SHALL have proper URLs
5. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fallback to the default language

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging tools, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL show detailed error messages with file locations
2. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and displayed appropriately
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging
4. WHEN source maps are enabled THEN errors SHALL point to original .mtm file locations
5. IF the build process fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want production build optimization, so that I can deploy efficient applications with minimal bundle sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I build for production THEN the system SHALL optimize and minify all generated code
2. WHEN I analyze the bundle THEN unused code SHALL be tree-shaken effectively
3. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL have optimal performance metrics
4. WHEN I deploy THEN the routing SHALL work correctly in production environments
5. IF there are performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide optimization suggestions
