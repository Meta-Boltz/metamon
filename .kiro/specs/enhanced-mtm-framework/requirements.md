# Enhanced MTM Framework Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements an enhanced MTM (Meta-Template-Metamon) framework with professional routing, component imports, and compilation options. The framework supports link-based navigation, external JavaScript compilation, and seamless integration with existing React/Vue/Svelte components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Link-Based Routing System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use standard HTML links for navigation so that I can create SEO-friendly and accessible routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `<a href="/path">Link</a>` in templates THEN the system SHALL intercept clicks and perform client-side navigation
2. WHEN defining `route: "/path"` in MTM files THEN the system SHALL register the route for the page
3. WHEN creating a Link component THEN the system SHALL provide `<Link href="/path">Text</Link>` syntax
4. WHEN navigating via links THEN the system SHALL update the URL and browser history
5. WHEN accessing direct URLs THEN the system SHALL load the correct page component

### Requirement 2: Route Definition and Page Metadata

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define routes and metadata at the top of MTM files so that I can organize my application structure clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining `route: "/path"` THEN the system SHALL register the route for client-side navigation
2. WHEN defining `title: "Page Title"` THEN the system SHALL set the document title and meta tags
3. WHEN defining `description: "Page description"` THEN the system SHALL generate SEO meta tags
4. WHEN defining multiple routes THEN the system SHALL create a routing table for the application
5. WHEN routes conflict THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3: JavaScript Compilation Options

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control where JavaScript is compiled so that I can optimize performance and caching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `compileJs: "inline"` THEN the system SHALL embed JavaScript directly in HTML files
2. WHEN using `compileJs: "external.js"` THEN the system SHALL generate separate JavaScript files
3. WHEN using external compilation THEN the system SHALL automatically include script tags in HTML
4. WHEN generating external files THEN the system SHALL optimize for caching and performance
5. WHEN not specifying compileJs THEN the system SHALL default to inline compilation

### Requirement 4: Component Import System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to import existing React/Vue/Svelte components so that I can reuse my existing component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `import ComponentName from "@path/Component.tsx"` THEN the system SHALL resolve and import React components
2. WHEN using `import ComponentName from "@path/Component.vue"` THEN the system SHALL resolve and import Vue components
3. WHEN using `import ComponentName from "@path/Component.svelte"` THEN the system SHALL resolve and import Svelte components
4. WHEN using imported components in templates THEN the system SHALL render them correctly
5. WHEN components have props THEN the system SHALL support prop passing with MTM syntax

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Template System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced template system that supports component imports and link routing so that I can build complex applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `<ComponentName />` in templates THEN the system SHALL render imported components
2. WHEN using `<Link href="/path">Text</Link>` THEN the system SHALL generate client-side navigation links
3. WHEN using `<a href="/path">Text</a>` THEN the system SHALL intercept and handle as client-side navigation
4. WHEN passing props to components THEN the system SHALL support `<Component prop={$variable} />`
5. WHEN nesting components THEN the system SHALL maintain proper component hierarchy

### Requirement 6: Multi-Page Application Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build multi-page applications with MTM so that I can create complete web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling multiple MTM files THEN the system SHALL generate a complete SPA with routing
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL create an index.html with route handling
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support both SPA and static site generation modes
4. WHEN handling 404s THEN the system SHALL provide configurable fallback pages
5. WHEN using nested routes THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical routing structures
